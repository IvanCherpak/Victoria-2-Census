This project makes census out of your Victoria 2 saves.

Victoria 2 game map consists of provinces. Each province has its own population. Smallest population unit is **pop**.
Each pop has: culture, religion, location (= province where it lives), size and so on.


  - Script.py python script takes every pop from Victoria 2 save games (inside input folder) and appends it to output.csv file.
  - Interactive dashboard can be seen here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ivan.cherpak5169/viz/Victoria2populationcensus/Dashboard1
